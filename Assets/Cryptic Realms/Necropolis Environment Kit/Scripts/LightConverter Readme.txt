The lighting in the showcase scenes was created with HDRP in mind, if you use URP the lighting be overblown.
Use this script to change the light intensity of the whole scene for preview or preparation reasons only, I do not advise using it in your own scenes as it will change ALL the lights in the scene. In case you want to revert the lighting to the original values you can use the Revert or Restore defaults buttons in the script.

When you use it, as component is added to the lights so remember to clear the component via the script as well.

Use only for preview reasons or in case you want to prepare the prefabs with correct URP values before using said prefabs in your work scenes.
